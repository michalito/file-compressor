### Issues 
- Have a look at how the processing is done. 
- When Dragging and Dropping , batch processing does not work (might be fixed). 
- Max compression now does webp files which are only openned on brower.

### Features
- Add a feature to add a watermark on the image
- Maybe instead of having the markers on the image preview for status , the button can change colours. Or something else.
- Improve the architecture of main.js (separate, clean)
- fix UI for settings on mobile screen size

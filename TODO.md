### Issues 
- Have a look at how the processing is done. Does it do resize and compress on the resize? if i resize or just compress do i do it on the original file? investigate and improve
- When Dragging and Dropping , batch processing does not work (might be fixed). 

### Features
- Add a feature to add a watermark on the image
- Maybe instead of having the markers on the image preview for status , the button can change colours. Or something else.
- Improve the architecture of main.js (separate, clean)
- fix UI for settings on mobile screen size
